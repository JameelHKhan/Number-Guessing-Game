# Number-Guessing-Game

Week 3 assignments from Intro to Java at JHU

Skills: Control statements, loops and iteration statements, relational and logical operators

Part 1 (Asterisk.java): This program prompts the user to select a maximum number of asterisks to display on a line of output as well as a choice of two different patterns: pine tree or tornado.  It will then utilize a for and while loop to output the selected pattern.

Part 2 (Number.java): This program is a number guessing game.  It starts by prompting the user to select a range between 1 and N for the random number to be generated as well as to select the maximum number of guesses that can be made.  The program will then generate a random number and prompt the user to make a guess.  The program will respond to each guess with a "correct," "too low,", or "too high" message.  The number of guesses made is tracked and the game continues until the user guesses the correct number or exceeds the maximum number of allowed guesses.  The program will also prompt the user to play again until the user declines to do so.
